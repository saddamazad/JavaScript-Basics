// We already know Literal means fixed value, so Object literal means object with fixed values
// Object literals are also called object `initializers`, the default values that the object is initialized with
// Object `property` values can be changed later though


// we're setting `fixed values` for the object properties during declaration, so it's an object literal
const myObj = {name: "Azad", city: "Dhaka"};


// let x = 5; // literal syntax
// let y = "Rahim"; // literal syntax

/* since these are fixed values, so these are literals */

// "Test String"; // literal
// 30 * 48; // literal
